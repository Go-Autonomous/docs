## Executive Summary

**Axon** is the central command center for our intent model. It is a fully interactive **Intent Control Center** that empowers you to visualize your intent hierarchy via a tree structure, customize terminology, manage training data, and reorganize categories.

By allowing you to deactivate unused standard intents and build custom ones, Axon ensures the AI model perfectly mirrors your specific business reality.

## 1. The Active Intent Tree

The **Main View** allows you to manage your intent hierarchy in real-time.

### Managing Hierarchy

- **Visual Tree:** Intents are displayed in a nested structure (Category \> Subcategory \> Intent).
- **Drag & Drop:** Move intents and sub-categories between parents.
  - _Note:_ Dragging an intent to a closed folder will automatically expand it.
- **Multi-Select:** Use checkboxes to move or deactivate multiple items at once.

### Editor Mode

When you drag an intent, edit a name, or add a category, the system enters **Editor Mode**.

- **Save Changes:** Commits all adjustments and updates the "Last Edited" metadata.
- **Discard:** Reverts the tree to its previous state.

<Warning>
  **Validation Error:** You cannot rename an intent to match an existing name. If a duplicate is detected, the system will prevent the save.
</Warning>

## 2. Adding & Deactivating Content

### Adding Categories & Intents

Hover your mouse between existing items to trigger the "Add" line:

1. **Add Category/Subcategory:** Opens a modal for naming.
2. **Add New Intent:** Opens the **Intent Builder**.

### Deactivating vs. Deleting

| Action         | Item Type            | Result                                                       |
| :------------- | :------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Deactivate** | Intent               | Moved to Deactivated Page; can be restored later.            |
| **Delete**     | Category/Subcategory | **Permanent.** Can only be deleted if no intents are inside. |

<Note>
  When deactivating a category, all nested intents move to the "Deactivated" list, but the category structure itself is deleted.
</Note>

## 3. Intent Builder & Training

To refine how the AI identifies an intent, click on an intent name to open the Editor.

### Metadata & Description

- **Name:** The user-facing label seen in Flow and Workstation.
- **Description:** The actual prompt used by the AI model to understand the intent.

### Linking Training Data

Use the **"Link from Workstation"** button to:

1. Search and filter real subject lines.
2. Select real email examples to use as training data.
3. The system automatically deduplicates identical examples.

## 4. Deactivated Intents

If you need to restore a standard or custom intent, navigate to the **Deactivated Intents** tab.

- **View Metadata:** See the original location and date of deactivation.
- **Reactivate:** Click the reactivate button. You will be prompted to select a **mandatory** Category and Subcategory for the intent's new home.

---

## Logic & State Management

- **Historical Data:** Deleting a custom intent or deactivating a standard one does **not** change historical labels on old emails. It only affects new incoming traffic.
- **Unsaved Changes:** A warning modal will appear if you attempt to leave the page with pending edits in Editor Mode.
- **Role Permissions:** "Annotator Intents" are hidden from standard Admin/Manager views to keep the interface clean.
