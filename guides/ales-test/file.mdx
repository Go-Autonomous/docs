<Icon icon="face-angry" color="#9a010b" /> We all have experienced the uncertainty and annoyance on really knowing if Gemini is using our code to eeply your questions.

> For example: I start a question and it ends up replying something really silly:
>
> <Icon icon="face-awesome" color="#cafd04" /> : Hey can you explain me the logic on how this customer uses this?
>
> <Icon icon="message-bot" iconType="solid" color="#0595f6" />: Sure a customer is someone that buys from you so this is the logic behind him/she being your customer.

After reading these types of answers multiple times, my annoyance levels were really high.

So this article is to teach you on how to be sure that it is working properly.

There are 2 ways to handle this when having a **Google Workspace account**  (an email provided by a company or school) rather than a personal `@gmail.com` account, as we do.

Workspace accounts often have "Personalization" features (like _Your instructions_) disabled by organization administrators for data privacy reasons.

Since you can't save the URL in settings, here are the two best workarounds to avoid pasting that URL every time:

### Option 1. Check "Connected Apps" (Visible in your screenshot)

In your screenshot, the top option is **Connected Apps**. This is the alternative menu for Extensions in some Workspace editions.

- **Action:** Click **Connected Apps**.
- **Look for:** A "GitHub" toggle or generic "Google Workspace" extensions.
- **If you find GitHub there:** Enable it. Once enabled, you can simply type `@GitHub` in your chat to search your repositories without needing to paste the full URL every time.

### Option 2. The "Long-Running Thread" Strategy (Best Alternative)

Since you cannot set global instructions, the most efficient way to work is to stop creating "New Chats."

- **Create a Master Chat:** Start a new chat, paste your GitHub URL, and say: _"Context: I am working on this repo. Let's use this thread for all coding tasks."_
- **Rename it:** Click the 3 dots next to the chat title in the sidebar and rename it to your project name (e.g., "Project Phoenix Dev").
- **Reuse it:** Every time you have a question, go back to **that specific chat**. I have a very long memory within a single thread, so I will remember the URL and previous code snippets indefinitely, effectively simulating "custom instructions."

A "Master Chat" isn't a button you click; it is a **workflow strategy** where you create one conversation thread and keep reusing it forever, effectively turning it into a long-term workspace.

Since you don't have the "Instructions" menu, this is the most effective way to "teach" me your project context once and never repeat it again.

I tried the **first Option :**

## And as a result.... <Icon icon="drum" color="#5db021" />     Option 2 is the best....

Here is the step-by-step guide to setting one up:

<Steps>
  <Step title='Step 1: Create and "prime" the chat'>
    Start a brand new chat and paste a comprehensive setup prompt. This will be the "brain" of this thread.

    - **Action:** Click **New Chat**.
    - **Type this (fill in your details):**

      > "I am creating this thread to serve as the Master Chat for my project. Here is the context:
      > - **Repository URL:** [Insert your GitHub URL]
      > - **Tech Stack:** [e.g., Python, React, AWS]
      > - **My Role:** [e.g., I am learning, or I am the lead dev]
      > - **Goal:** [e.g., We are building a CRM system]
      >
      > Please remember this context for every future message in this specific conversation thread. Do not ask me for the URL again."
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2: Rename the Chat (Crucial)">
    By default, I will name the chat something random based on your first question. You need to give it a clear label so you can find it next week.

    - **Action:** Look at the left-hand sidebar where your "Recent" chats are listed.
    - **Action:** Hover over the chat you just created.
    - **Action:** Click the **three dots (...)** or the **Pencil icon**.
    - **Action:** Select **Rename** and call it something obvious like:
      - `📍 MASTER - Project Phoenix`
      - `🧠 GitHub Context - MyWebsite`

    ### 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 3: the New outine">
    This is the hard part—changing your habit.

    - **Old Habit:** Opening Gemini and immediately typing in the big empty box (this creates a New Chat and wipes my memory).
    - **New Habit:** Opening Gemini, \*\*clicking your \*\*`📍 MASTER`**chat in the sidebar** , and continuing the conversation there.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Why this works

Current AI models (like the one running Gemini) have a massive "context window" (memory). As long as you stay in that one thread, I can "see" that first message you sent 3 weeks ago containing your GitHub URL.
