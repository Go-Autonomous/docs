## Order Extraction Process

Our AI extracts order details directly from incoming communications.

### 1. Data Sources

The AI monitors the following for Eco Logistics Corp:

- **Email Body:** Primary extraction for urgent "Rush" flags.
- **PDF Attachments:** Standard Purchase Orders (PO) containing line items.

### 2. Account Resolution Logic

When a new email arrives, the AI performs **Account Resolution** to match data to your ERP:

| Extracted Field  | Resolution Method               | ERP Field      |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------ | :------------- |
| Customer ID      | Regex Match from Header         | `CUST_REF_ID`  |
| Shipping Address | Fuzzy Match against Master Data | `SHIP_TO_CODE` |
| Item Numbers     | Semantic Lookup (AI-driven)     | `SKU_PRIMARY`  |

<Steps>
  ### Step 1: Extraction

  The AI identifies a PDF named `PO_12345.pdf`. It uses OCR to pull the table of items.

  ### Step 2: Resolution

  The AI matches "Glo-Logistics" in the email to the ERP entity `GLC_9901`.

  ### Step 3: Integration

  The system pushes a `POST` request to the ERP endpoint to create a draft order.
